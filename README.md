# AmE-dictionary
A simple shared dictionary to be enhanced with flash-like cards (maybe we can write something using HTML and JavaScript, like this [HTML editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/htmleditor/)).

### Resources

I collect words from multiple sources, including:
* Tons of printed newspapers: USA Today, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, The Moscow News, The Moscow Times, etc.
* Posts by [Susan Rooks (The Grammar Goddess)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grammargoddess) (don't miss her Tuesday Tricksters!)

Note: For help editing with Markdown in GitHub, you can visit [writing on github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/), and for emojis, visit the [emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/). By the way, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (絵, "picture") + moji (文字, "character").
