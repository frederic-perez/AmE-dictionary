A simple shared dictionary to be enhanced with flash-like cards (maybe we can write something using HTML and JavaScript, like this [HTML editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/htmleditor/)).

Note: For help editing with Markdown in GitHub, you can visit [writing on github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/), and for emojis, visit the [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or the [emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/). By the way, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (絵, "picture") + moji (文字, "character").
