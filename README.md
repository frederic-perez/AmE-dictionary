# AmE-dictionary

A simple shared dictionary to be enhanced with flash-like cards (maybe we can write something using HTML and JavaScript, like this [HTML editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/htmleditor/)).

## Resources

### Audio Resources

I also gather interesting stuff from a myriad of [podcasts](list-of-podcasts.md).

In addition, I listen to a lot of stuff from [comedians](list-of-comedians.md).

## Emojis

Meaning of the emojis used in the dictionary:

- :pencil2: Interesting or funny spelling
- :mega: Interesting or funny pronunciation
- :mute: Silent letter
- :astonished: Interesting or funny for any other reason
- :hammer: Undefined word
- :dart: Try to learn this particular one!
- :octocat: Trick aimed at remembering the meaning

Note: For help editing with Markdown in GitHub, you can visit [writing on github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/), and for emojis, visit the [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or the [emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/). By the way, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (絵, "picture") + moji (文字, "character").
