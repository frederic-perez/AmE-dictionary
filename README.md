# AmE-dictionary

A simple shared dictionary to be enhanced with flash-like cards (maybe we can write something using HTML and JavaScript, like this [HTML editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/htmleditor/)).

## Resources

I collect words from multiple sources, including:

- Tons of printed newspapers: USA Today, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, International New York Times (and The New York Times International Edition), The Japan Times, International Herald Tribune, New York Post, San Francisco Chronicle, The Denver Post, Austin American-Statesman, The Salt Lake Tribune, The Moscow News, The Moscow Times, Town Topics(R) (Princeton's Weekly Community Newspaper Since 1946), The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana, Danville and East Central Illinois), Metro (The world's most popular free newspaper), (London) Evening Standard, etc.

Note: For help editing with Markdown in GitHub, you can visit [writing on github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/), and for emojis, visit the [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or the [emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/). By the way, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (絵, "picture") + moji (文字, "character").
