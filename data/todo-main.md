The canary has also given us the idiom “canary in the coal mine” to refer to something that gives an early warning of a danger or failure. Due to their small size, canaries are more susceptible to carbon monoxide and other dangerous gases and were carried by coal miners in the mine shafts. __1__ A small finch, native to the Canary Islands, having greenish to yellow color, and known for its melodious song. __2__ A bright yellow color. __3__ A singer. _He enjoyed a close friendship with the MGM canary Kathryn Grayson, with whom he starred in Show Boat._ __4__ An informer. _The two high-ranking mobsters were named in a 39-count indictment in Brooklyn federal court yesterday, which made use of wiretaps and the recordings of a canary who is working with the government._
