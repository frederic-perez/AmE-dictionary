__stump__  _v_ :eight: There are three ways to stump: you can ask someone a question they can't answer, you can travel making political speeches, or you can stomp. Stump can mean many things as a verb. The most common use is when someone — like a teacher — asks a question that no one can answer. That's a case of the teacher stumping the class. Also, politicians traveling through a district, making speeches are stumping, giving what are called stump speeches. Once in a while, to stump means the same thing as two similar words, stomp and stamp. If you're stumping, stomping, and stamping around, you're making a lot of noise with your feet.  
__stunned__ _adj_ :four: When you're stunned, you're thrown for a loop: either by shocking news or a blow to the head.

Some people are stunned by good news that is kind of amazing, like a NASA flight to Mars. On the other hand, getting whacked in the head can leave you stunned. Getting the wind knocked out of you will do the same.

Another synonym, infuse, looks a lot like suffuse. Both words come from the Latin word fundere, which means "to pour." _It suffuses you with mild pleasure._
